# Chick-fil-A Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides insights into Chick-fil-A sales data by cleaning and analyzing the dataset to explore sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance. Using SQL, I demonstrate data cleaning techniques and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to address various business questions. The insights from this project can support data-driven decisions for improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **Sales transactions**: Detailed information on transaction times, product lines, and total amounts.
- **Customer demographics**: Basic demographic information such as gender and customer type.
- **Branch and city information**: Identifies the location of each transaction.
